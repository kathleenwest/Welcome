## Welcome to GitHub Pages

This GitHub has a limited number of projects from my school, professional development courses, and some scripts used in the real world. 

If you are looking at this page as part of your evaluation on my coding skills, please understand these examples are from the classroom and personal pursuits of being an IT wizard. I cannot share my former employer and client coding projects on this site per my non-disclosure agreements. My client software projects were bigger and more impressive than those listed in the repositories.

If you are looking to evaluate me on additional coding, writing samples, design files, etc. please e-mail me at hello.kathleen.west@gmail.com and I will invite you to my DropBox repository of samples.
